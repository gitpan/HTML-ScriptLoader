HTML-ScriptLoader
==============================

This package can handle script loading with dependencies.

This makes it easier to load and send only the needed scripts to your users.
You don't have to think about ordering and dependencies between the scripts,
as all the needed scripts are prepared and loaded in the correct order as you
have defined it in your configuration file of preference.
